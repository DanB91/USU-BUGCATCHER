1.The Triangle program accepts three integer values, which represent three angles of the triangle.
<br/>
2. If the input of the values are invalid (no bigger than 0 or not integers), or if fewer than three values provided, it will show "Invalid input value".
<br/>
3. If the sum of three values of the angle is not equal to 180, then it will output the message "Not a Triangle".
<br/>
4. Otherwise, it will output whether the triangle is a right triangle, obtuse or acute.
<br/>
5.All three inputs must be less than or equal to 2000000000. If not, it will output,"Error: All three inputs must be less than or equal to 2000000000."
<br/>
6.All three inputs must be integers. If not, it will output, "Error:  All three inputs must be integers."
<br/>
7.If there is another reason the inputs are invalid it will output, "Error: Bad Input".
