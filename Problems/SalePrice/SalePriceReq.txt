1. SalePrice takes in two numbers - an original price, and a percent discount. It outputs the new price after applying that discount. If given 100 and 9, for example, it will output 91.0 
<br/>
2. If the discount is strictly less than 0 or strictly greater than 100, SalePrice will output "Discount must be between 0 and 100".
