Encoder takes a string and an int, and shifts all the characters in the string by that int ("a" 1 becomes "b").
1)LINE 30: Adds 26 when the shifted letter is a, shifting it past z. (Should be strictly <).
2)LINE 20: Mods by 25 instead of 26.
3)LINE 35: Subtracts rather than taking the mod, meaning it will not work on large inputs.
4)LINE 12: Takes the absolute value, making it not work on negative shifts.
5)Does not check if input is an integer
6)Does not include "try...catch" for invalid inputs
