Encoder takes a string and an int, and shifts all the characters in the string by that int ("a" 1 becomes "b").
LINE 30: Adds 26 when the shifted letter is a, shifting it past z. (Should be strictly <).
LINE 20: Mods by 25 instead of 26.
LINE 35: Subtracts rather than taking the mod, meaning it will not work on large inputs.
LINE 12: Takes the absolute value, making it not work on negative shifts.
