<h1>Student Help</h1>


<h2>Registering and Getting Started</h2>

<ul>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<ul>
You must register to take part in the competition.  Click "register" and enter your first name, last name, school, select your state, and choose a username and password.  Make sure student is selected as your user type, then click "Register".  This will create an account for you.
</ul>

<h4>Logging In</h4>
<ul>
Once you have registered, you need to log in.  Enter the username and password you chose, and click "log in", then wait for the administrator to give you the competition ID.  When he does, you will select it in the "Available Competitions" list and click "Join Competition".  If the competition ID you have been given does not show up in the list, click "Refresh" and look again.
</ul>

<h4>Teams</h4>
<ul>
Now that you have logged in, you need to be on a team to compete (it is possible to be on a team all by yourself).  The administrator will create your teams; please wait patiently for further instructions from him.  When everyone is on a team, the administrator will begin the competition.
</ul>
</ul>


<h2>Competing</h2>

<ul>
<h4>Time Left</h4>
<ul>
There is a countdown timer in the top left corner that displays how many minutes are left in the competition.  The competition administrator has the ability to pause this timer; if he does so, you will be unable to enter test cases until he resumes the competition.
</ul>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
There is a requirements section on the left edge of the window.  This contains information about how the code in that problem should be working.  It also gives you instructions on how to format your input.
</ul>

<h4>Uncovering a Bug</h4>
<ul>
If the code returns an unexpected or incorrect value, then a bug is uncovered.  For example: if I enter into a calculator program 2 * 3, I expect to get a 6 for my answer.  If the program has a bug or mistake, then it will return something other than 6, and I have uncovered a bug.
</ul>

<h4>Entering a Test Case</h4>
<ul>
The test case input is on the right side of the window.  Here you can enter test cases to uncover bugs.  To enter a test case, follow the format given in the requirements section or found by hovering over the "Test Input" label.  Following this format, place your input in the "Test Input" text box.    Then, in the "Expected Output" text box, enter the output you would expect if the program were functioning properly.  Now click "Test For Bug!".  Your results box will display whether you found a new bug, a repeat bug, or did not find a bug.
</ul>

<h4>Test Results</h4>
<ul>
The results message box is located just below the "Test For Bug!" button.  This message will inform you of whether you have found a new bug, repeat bug, or no bug.
</ul>

<ul>
<h5>New Bug Found</h5>
<ul>
If a test case you entered uncovers a new bug in the code, it will display a message telling you that you found a bug.  If you find a bug, your window will also display an animation of a bug being caught and increase the count of bugs found.
</ul>

<h5>Repeat Bug Found</h5>
<ul>
If your input uncovered a bug you have already uncovered, you will get a message in your results box telling you that you have already found that bug.
</ul>

<h5>No Bug Found</h5>
<ul>
If your input did not uncover a bug, you will get a message in your results box telling you that you did not find a bug.
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Results Text Box</h4>
<ul>
 As well as displaying test results, the results text box will also display any hints the admin chooses to send and the chat messages of your teammates.  The messages in this box can be filtered using the check boxes below.  By default, hints and chats are shown, these can be turned off by unchecking the "Hints" or "Chats" boxes.  By default, only the test cases for the current problem are displayed.  You can choose to show all test cases by checking "All Tests".
</ul>

<h4>Navigating Between Problems</h4>
<ul>
Your competition may have 1 to 8 problems.  To work on a problem, click "Select problem" just above the main text box.  A selection box will open, and you should click the problem you would like to work on. If wish to cancel this action, click the 'x' in the top right corner of the selection box.
</ul>

<h4>Code Coverage</h4>
<ul>
Code coverage highlights the code executed by your last test case.  There is an on/off switch for this underneath the problem selection tabs.  The administrator may disable code coverage, if he has, you will not have this option.
</ul>

<h4>Bugs Found</h4>
<ul>
On the top banner, there is a number labeled "Bugs Found" this number represents the total number of bugs you have found so far.
</ul>

<h4>Scoring and Ranking</h4>
<ul>
The scores are based on how many bugs you find and how long it takes you to find them.  The top three teams will be displayed near the top left corner.
</ul>

<h4>Finishing a Problem</h4>
<ul>
In real life, we never know when we have found all the bugs.  For this reason, we do not provide the number of bugs in each problem.  You should use your own discretion in moving between problems and dividing your time.
</ul>

<h4>Logging out</h4>
<ul>
To log out, click the "Log Out" link in the top right corner.  Once you have logged out, you may log back in using the same method you used to initially log in.
