1.The Triangle program accepts three integer values, which represent three value of angle in the triangle.
<BR/>
2. If the input of the values are invalid( no bigger than 0 or not integers), or if fewer than three values provided, it will show "Invalid input value".
<BR/>
3. If the sum of three values of the angle is not equal 180, then it will output the message "Not a Triangle".
<BR/>
4. If the sum of three values of the angle is equal 180, and one of the value is greater than 90, then it will output the message "obtuse triangle".
<BR/>
5. If the sum of three values of the angle is equal 180, and one of the value is equal to 90, then it will output the message "Right triangle".
<BR/>
6. If the sum of three values of the angle is equal 180, but all of them is less than 90, then it will output the message "Acute triangle".
