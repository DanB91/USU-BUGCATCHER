1. The Cipher encrypts messages by taking a String and an integer.
The string represents the message to be encrypted, and the integer the amount to shift each letter of the string by.
For example, Cipher abc 4 would return "efg" and Cipher ABC -1 would return ZAB
2. If the input is invalid or Cipher is not given two arguments, it will return "Invalid input."
3. The cipher should maintain capitalization and accept any integer.
